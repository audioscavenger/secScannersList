# secScannersList
This repo will contain data about so called "security scanners" â€“ companies that scan all hosts in internet and making databases with hosts data

Most of them declare "this is for your own good and for cleaner internet". 
Still, they scan your host without your permission, wich formally makes their actions abusive (sadly, many providers and hosters are completely ignoring it). Also, they try make money on it.

What can we do:
1. Opt out. You can write on special email and ask to stop scanning you. Works only if they up to it, but still worth trying. List of emails and email example is in optOuts folder;
2. Block them. Some companies are ignoring stop reqjests. Shodan.io is one oldest example. Blocklists (/24 subnets) are in blocklists folder;
3. Shame them. Do not hesitate to report abusive actions to hoster/provider (https://www.abusix.com will help), and to post your case to https://abuseipdb.com for example;
4. Adding them to whitelist in your log analyzer if what they do is OK for you. Also an option.

No warranty whatsoever. Use this repo at your own risk.
Additions are welcome.
